# Hospital Management System - Complete Implementation Request

## Project Overview
Create a complete hospital management system based on the existing project requirements. Implement a modern, full-stack application with emphasis on excellent frontend design and user experience.

## Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: Reflex (Python-based framework - recommended for complex web apps)
- **Database**: MySQL (existing Docker container)
- **Project Structure**: All code organized in a folder named `FastAPI-Hospital`

## Database Configuration
- **Database Name**: `hospital`
- **Username**: `mjonny4`
- **Password**: `mjonny4`
- **Connection**: MySQL running in Docker container (assume localhost:3306)

## Implementation Order & Requirements

### 1. Database Models (First Priority)
- Design comprehensive MySQL database schema with proper tables and relationships
- Include proper data validation and foreign key constraints
- Consider tables like: patients, doctors, appointments, medical_records, staff, departments, etc.
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations

### 2. API Endpoints (Second Priority)
- Create complete RESTful API using FastAPI
- Include CRUD operations for all entities
- Implement proper error handling and response models
- Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include data validation and sanitization

### 3. Frontend Application (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Critical Requirement**: Focus extensively on frontend design and user experience
- Create an intuitive, modern, and responsive interface
- Implement clean, professional design suitable for healthcare environment
- Include proper navigation and user workflows
- Add interactive elements and real-time updates where appropriate
- Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness
- Create different dashboards for different user roles (admin, doctor, nurse, receptionist)

### 4. Authentication System (Final Priority)
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT token management
- Password hashing and security best practices
- Session management

## Specific Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Follow Python best practices and proper project structure
- **Documentation**: Include README with setup instructions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for healthcare data
- **Performance**: Optimize for good performance and scalability

## Deliverables
1. Complete project folder structure
2. Database models and connection setup
3. FastAPI backend with all endpoints
4. Frontend application with excellent UX/UI
5. Authentication and authorization system
6. Documentation and setup instructions

**Note**: The frontend is the most critical component - prioritize creating an exceptional user interface and experience that healthcare professionals would actually want to use.

Final Step: Database Population Script
5. Data Population (After Everything is Complete)

Requirement: Create a Python script to populate the database with realistic test data
Medical Specialties: Include one doctor for each major medical specialty:

Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine
Internal Medicine, Surgery, Radiology, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry
Dermatology, Ophthalmology, ENT, Oncology, Gynecology


Patient Data: Generate realistic patient records with proper medical history
Appointments: Create realistic appointment schedules and medical records
Staff Data: Include nurses, administrators, and support staff
Data Quality: Use realistic names, addresses, phone numbers, and medical data
Privacy Compliant: Use synthetic data that resembles real data but isn't actual personal information

Script Requirements:

Separate Python script (populate_database.py)
Use faker library or similar for generating realistic data
Ensure data relationships are properly maintained
Include data validation before insertion
Add progress indicators and logging during population process

PLEASE CREATE A VENV FOLDER AND MAKE ALL THE PROJECT IN THE ROOT FOLDER . ALSO EVERYTIME INSTALL THE PACKAGES BEFORE MAKING THE FILE.
